Problem A 
super trivial, solved under 2 minutes 

Problem B 
this took me almost half an hour 
wasn't obvious to keep track of min and max
even after submitted it, im still not 100% sure why it works
intuitively it makes sense, you store min because it can become max next turn 
but i didnt have time to proove


Problem C 
Main problem for me 
About 5k AC so rule of thumb I should have done this 

I got the idea to sort and take each element that didnt appear
Had the right idea but approach was too slow O(n^2)

What i did wrong
- maintained a set, and then for each element in the set check if x is divisible

What is better 
- every time you add element, add ALL its multiples into a pool of seen numbers 
- the trick is that if k divided by number is longer than the array you just exit
- otherwise you only need to look at n muliples which should be sufficient 

with my approach, i run through the entire set for each element which is n^2 

the other approach still appears to be n^2 but apparently not
